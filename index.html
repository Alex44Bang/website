                    I hope I'm not bothering you with what I'm about to say. I want to sincerely apologize for not treating you the way you deserved and for leaving you hanging. 
                    I've thought deeply about my mistakes, and I want to improve. I hope you've noticed some of that during the time we've spent together after the incident.
                </p>

You are my first true love and a woman with whom I can envision a future, getting married, and having children someday. 
I want to prove that I'm worthy of being by your side. 
You are not too demanding for me; you are exactly what I need. 
Your presence always fills me with a heartwarming feeling.
</p>
<p class ="text">
Here's my suggestion: Let's give it a try for a month as my last chance. 
Let me take you out on dates, give you flowers, be there for you emotionally, and always have an open ear for you.
I want to start asking you every week how you feel about me and what I can improve on so that I never lose track of you.
I love you more than anything, and it would be a shame if things ended this way. 
Additionally, I would like to invite you on a trip, maybe during the next semester break if that works for you.
</p>
<p class ="text">
Well, that's enough talking from me. Now I'll leave the choice to you :)
